# To-Do List Application by HM

# About
    This is a simple To-Do List application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to add, delete, load, and save tasks.

# Features
    1. Add tasks to the list
    2. Delete tasks from the list
    3. Load tasks from a file (tasks.dat)
    4. Save tasks to a file (tasks.dat)

# How to Use
    1. Run the application by executing the Python script.
    2. Enter a task in the text entry field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
    3. Select a task from the list and click the "Delete Task" button to remove it.
    4. Click the "Load Task" button to load tasks from the tasks.dat file.
    5. Click the "Save Tasks" button to save the current tasks to the tasks.dat file.

# Code Structure
    The code is organized into the following sections:

    Importing necessary libraries (tkinter and pickle)
    Defining methods for adding, deleting, loading, and saving tasks
    Creating the GUI components (frames, listbox, scrollbar, entry field, and buttons)
    Configuring the GUI components and packing them into the main window
    Defining the main event loop using root.mainloop()
